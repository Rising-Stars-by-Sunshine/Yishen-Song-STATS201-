Iris Dataset

📊 Dataset Overview

The Iris Dataset is a classic and widely used dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify the samples into one of three species:
	•	🌸 Iris-setosa
	•	🌸 Iris-versicolor
	•	🌸 Iris-virginica

This dataset is ideal for learning and demonstrating classification algorithms and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
